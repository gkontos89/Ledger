Front End vs Back End System Event Handling

For each System Event we need to answer the following:
	- What calculations must take place
	- Who performs calculations
	- What data is stored in BE vs FE
	- How the FE and BE will behave
	
# User Account
New User is created via the FE


Existing user opens/logs in to app


# Simulated Income
BE generates income (paycheck) available for user(s)



# Assets
BE creates a new asset in the market


FE purchases an asset from the market


FE sells an asset back to the market


Time to apply an associated recurring cost for an asset owned by a user


The current market value of an asset changes


# Non-Assets (Food, clothing)
BE creates a new non-asset in the market


FE purchases an asset from the market


# Simulated "speed bumps"
BE creates a new speed bump. ie. car has a flat tire, minus $50
